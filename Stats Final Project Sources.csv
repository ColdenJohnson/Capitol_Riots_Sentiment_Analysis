Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6%.","2011-03-01","2023-02-05 08:30:28","2023-02-05 08:30:28","2023-02-05 08:30:28","1-8","","1","2","","Journal of Computational Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\BKN9B8QY\Bollen et al. - 2011 - Twitter mood predicts the stock market.pdf","","","Collective mood; Sentiment tracking; Social networks; Stock market","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Very often people report causal relationships between events in their tweets. Automatic detection of causality information in these events might play an important role in predictive event analytics. Existing approaches include both rule-based and data-driven supervised methods. However, it is challenging to correctly identify event causality using only linguistic rules due to the highly unstructured nature and grammatical incorrectness of social media short text such as tweets. Also, it is difficult to develop a data-driven supervised method for event causality detection in tweets due to insufficient contextual information. This paper proposes a novel event context word extension technique based on background knowledge. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event context word extension technique, we develop a feed-forward neural network based approach to detect event causality from tweets.

Businesses (or similar entities) need to identify the polarity of these opinions in order to understand user orientation and thereby make smarter decisions. One such application is in the field of politics, where political entities need to understand public opinion and thus determine their campaigning strategy. Sentiment analysis on social media data has been seen by many as an effective tool to monitor user preferences and inclination. Popular text classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM are Supervised Learning Algorithms which require a training data set to perform Sentiment analysis. The accuracy of these algorithms is contingent upon the quantity as well as the quality (features and contextual relevance) of the labeled training data. Since most applications suffer from lack of training data, they resort to cross domain sentiment analysis which misses out on features relevant to the target data. This, in turn, takes a toll on the overall accuracy of text classification. In this paper, we propose a two stage framework which can be used to create a training data from the mined Twitter data without compromising on features and contextual relevance. Finally, we propose a scalable machine learning model to predict the election results using our two stage framework.","2016-08","2023-03-09 13:58:11","2023-03-09 13:58:11","","1-5","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\ZVRRQQ2X\7823280.html","","","Algorithm design and analysis; Classification algorithms; labeling; sentiment analysis; Sentiment analysis; Text categorization; text classification; Training; training data; Training data; Twitter; Vader","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We train the latter on the supervised training data recently made available by the official system evaluation campaign on Twitter Sentiment Analysis organized by Semeval-2015.

Public support, in turn, is highly dynamic and erratic, and can be influenced by current events, including political/economic policy announcements, ongoing scandals, treatment in the media, and general propaganda. The current POTUS, Donald Trump, is unique because, for the first time, the office of POTUS has direct access to social media platforms that offer a direct avenue of communication with the general population. Can the social media presence of POTUS influence the public approval of the administration? In this paper, we analyze the relationship between tweets generated by POTUS and his approval rating using sentiment-analytics and data visualization tools. The twitter feed of POTUS is mined, cleaned, and given a quantitative measure based on word content, called the “sentiment score”. By comparing tweets before the election, between election and inauguration, and after the inauguration, we find that the sentiment score for Mr. Trump's feed has increased on average with time by a factor of 60%. Using cross-correlation analysis, we find a preliminary causative relationship between POTUS twitter activity and approval rating. The findings provide a new perspective on the forces that influences public opinion, and the general strategy can be used for other analyses in the future.","2020-01","2023-03-09 13:58:35","2023-03-09 13:58:35","","0640-0646","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\M7WGQCJR\9031237.html","","","Application Program Interface; Approval Rate; Feeds; Media; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment Analysis; Supervised and Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis; Tools; Twitter; Voting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 10th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We address the problem of using standard topic models in micro-blogging environments by studying how the models can be trained on the dataset. We propose several schemes to train a standard topic model and compare their quality and effectiveness through a set of carefully designed experiments from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

Given an event and an associated large-scale collection of tweets, there are two fundamental research problems that have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One is to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified framework. We evaluate the proposed model both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.","2012","2023-03-09 14:00:54","2023-03-09 14:00:54","2023-03-09 14:00:54","59-65","","1","26","","","ET-LDA","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2021 Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","","","","ojs.aaai.org","","Number: 1","","C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\ECVDFDYG\Hu et al. - 2012 - ET-LDA Joint Topic Modeling for Aligning Events a.pdf","","","Bayesian Learning; ET-LDA; Event; Events; LDA; Machine Learning; Public Event; Public Events; Social Computing; Social Media; Social Netowrks; Topic Modeling; Tweets; Twitter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
